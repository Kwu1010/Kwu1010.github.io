Use MongoDB to store project items to allow for queries of what was language, tools, or concepts were used
    Create a ER diagram & relational model to implement into MongoDB
    Projects should contains a description
    Projects should have a link to the Github repository
    Projects should list the tags of what tools, languages, and concepts were used
    Projects should showcase the code and break it down

    MCFunctions should have multiple downloadable versions for compatibility across MC versions

Create a status indicator using JS, where it shows if queries are possible currently based on in MongoDB queries have been used up
Specify that projects will be shown even if no more queries can be made (so you remember to update both for consistency)

Each project should have a page, with a slideshow of images to show off the code, GUI, or use
Images are stored in the images folder under projects
MongoDB should store the path for each project html as an attribute
